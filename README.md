		     FIX_TABS v 0.1

*****************************************************

	Do you use different editors to edit your 
programs depending on where you are?

	Do some of your editors use tabs and some
use spaces? Well look no further!

	Especially if you are using a whitespace 
separated language such as python, those Tab and
whitespace errors can be a nuisance.

	Fix tabs aims to fix your tab situation
for you, just indicate whether you want to use
tabs or spaces, and fix tabs will change your
file to replace the tabs and spaces to your 
liking
